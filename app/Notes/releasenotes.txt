Version 1.0.0 - Initial release

Introducing Revolving Fours - Connect 4 with a twist!

Main features of the application include:
    - Intuitive "Connect 4" gameplay on a 7x7 board
    - Ability to rotate the board instead of placing a piece
    - Select between eight color options for either player
    - Start a new game at any time with the click of a button
    - Winner will be determined when one player has more "straights" than the other

Note that screen orientation is fixed to portrait mode. Since the game is meant to be played
between two players passing the device, and the main characteristics of the game involve rotating
the board, allowing orientation changes alongside board rotations can make the game very confusing.
