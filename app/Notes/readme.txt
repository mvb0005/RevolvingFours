Revolving Fours is a game very similar to Connect 4, but with a twist (literally). If a player so
desires, they may use their turn to rotate the board clockwise, counterclockwise, or 180Â° instead
of placing a piece. This can, however, lead to multiple "straights" (4 in a row) with one move.
As a result, the game will only end when one player has more straights than the other player.
For scoring purposes, a string of 5 or more pieces in a row will only count as one straight.
