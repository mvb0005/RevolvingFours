Revolving Fours is a game very similar to Connect 4, but with a twist (literally). If a player so
desires, they may use their turn to rotate the board clockwise, counterclockwise, or 180Â° instead
of placing a piece. This can, however, lead to multiple connect 4's with one move. As a result,
the game will only end when one player has more connect 4's than the other player. For scoring
purposes, a string of 5 or more pieces in a row will only count as one connect 4.
